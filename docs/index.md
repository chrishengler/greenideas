# Green Ideas Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Green Ideas**, a Python package for generating grammatically valid but semantically nonsensical sentences using generative grammar principles.

## What is Generative Grammar?
Generative grammar is a linguistic theory that describes how sentences can be constructed from a set of rules. These rules define how words and phrases combine to form valid sentences in a language. Green Ideas uses recursive rewrite rules to build sentence trees, which can then be converted into templates for the [twaddle](https://github.com/chrishengler/twaddle) procedural text generator. Green Ideas includes a pre-written series of rules for generating English language sentences, which work with [the official Green Ideas twaddle dictionaries](https://github.com/chrishengler/greenideas-dict).

## Key Features
- Generation of sentence trees using user-defined or default grammar rules
- Modular, extensible grammar engine
- Conversion of sentence trees into twaddle-compatible templates
- Support for grammatical agreement and feature propagation
